# Ditto Labs

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

## Fun with Ditto!

The Ditto Labs are a way to try out experiments with Umbraco, Ditto and other 3rd party libraries.

This should not be considered as a serious effort. It is more to see what we can do with Ditto.

All code is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).

So far we have experiments with:

* [Community Contrib](src/Our.Umbraco.Ditto.Contrib)
* [Umbraco's Model Factory](src/Our.Umbraco.Ditto.ModelFactory)
* [Archetype](src/Our.Umbraco.Ditto.Archetype)
